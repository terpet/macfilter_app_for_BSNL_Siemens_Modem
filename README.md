# macfilter_app_for_BSNL_Siemens_Modem
I wrote a piece of code that automates the process of Filtering devices connected to your network .

The script provides three options

1.Enable/Disable MAC Filter
2.Add a MAC Address to Block List
3.Remove a MAC Address from Block List

Using the script, I can manage the MAC Filter without even clicking the mouse. No need to open the browser, no need to type in 192.168.1.1, no need to click any link. Just execute the script, enter your choice and VOILA ! The job is done. The script is a bit messy and can be shortened further.
